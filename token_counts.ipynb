        "Shannon borrowed the concept of entropy from statistical physics to develop _information theory_, focused on encoding and compressing messages. A few years later, in 1950, he applied information theory to analyze human predictive ability—in other words, the entropy of the human language model. You can read the original article, [Prediction and Entropy of Printed English](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf), for more details.\n",

Recall that Zipf's law states that a word's rank (from the most common word at rank 1 on down) to its frequency is approximately a constant, i.e., $r \\cdot f = k$. Equivalently, we can divide both sides by the total number of tokens $N$ to get $r \\cdot P_r = c$, where $c = k/N$ and $P_r = f/N$ is the _relative frequency_ of word $r$.\n",
